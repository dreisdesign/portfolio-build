## [1.3.0] - 2025-06-16

### Added
- **Intelligent Image Change Detection System** - Revolutionary performance improvement
  - Smart timestamp-based change detection for image processing
  - Only processes images that have actually changed or are missing outputs
  - Achieves 99%+ build time savings for typical development workflows
  - Clear debug output showing which images are processed vs skipped

### Enhanced
- **Build Performance** - Dramatic speed improvements
  - No image changes: ~0.1 seconds processing time (vs 2-3 minutes)
  - Few image changes: Only processes modified images (~3-5s per image)
  - Typical development workflow: 99%+ faster builds
  
### Technical Implementation
- **Change Detection Logic** - Compares source modification time against processed outputs
- **File Safety** - Never modifies source images, maintains clean source/build separation
- **Selective Processing** - Processes only when outputs missing or source is newer
- **Debug Logging** - Clear feedback on processing decisions

### Performance Examples
```
ðŸ“Š Image processing complete:
   â€¢ 0 images processed
   â€¢ 151 images skipped  
   â€¢ 0.1s total time
   â€¢ 99% build time saved
```
